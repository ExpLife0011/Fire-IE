This version no longer supports Firefox 13 or lower.

  * Cannot use Win7 taskbar's "Close All Windows" command to terminate Firefox (https://github.com/yxl/Fire-IE/issues/70).

  * Changing IE compatibility mode no longer requires Firefox to restart -- you could just restart the plugin process.

* The progress indicator of Tab Scope is sometimes broken.
* Some file:/// URIs cannot be recognized by the IE engine.
